# Output setup file for STEPWAT
#
# Notes:
# Time periods available:  DY,YR
#   eg, if DY is chosen then 100,200 would mean to use the second hundred days
#   But if YR is chosen, start and end numbers are in days so only those days
#   are reported for the yearly average.
#
# DEEPSWC produces output only if the deepdrain flag is set in siteparam.in.
#
# Filename prefixes should not have a file extension.
# Case is unimportant.
#
# SUMTYPEs are one of the following:
#  OFF - no output for this variable
#  SUM - sum the variable for each day in the output period
#  AVG - average the variable over the output period
#  FIN - output value of final day in the period; soil water variables only.
# Note that SUM and AVG are the same if timeperiod = DY.
#
# (01/17/2013) TIMESTEP key indicates which periods you want to output.
# You can output all the periods at a time, just one, or however many
# you want. To change which periods to output type 'dy' for day,
# 'wk' for week, 'mo' for month, and 'yr' for year after TIMESTEP
# in any order. For example: "TIMESTEP mo wk" will output for month and week
#
# (1/9/2018) USE_TIMESTEP: this determines if the TIMESTEP or PERIOD is used to define time periods for each individual output variable.
# If "USE_TIMESTEP = 0", then the time period for each output variable listed below will be determined by the PERIOD column. Note only 1 time period can be listed for each output variable using this option. 
# Also note that all of the time periods specified in the PERIOD column must be listed after TIMESTEP, so the correct output files are generated.   
# EX: if only using TRANSP and PRECIP and the periods are MO for TRANSP and DY for PRECIP TIMESTEP needs to be "TIMESTEP dy mo" so program knows to create day and month output files
# If "USE_TIMESTEP = 1", then all output variables listed below will be outputted for the time periods specified after TIMESTEP (e.g. dy, yr). Note, this option allows for output variables to be generated for multiple time periods.
# Also note that when using this option, each variable must only be listed once in the Table below. The PERIOD column is ignored with "USE_TIMESTEP = 1".
#
# To generate SWA output, the SWCBULK variable must also be requested.
