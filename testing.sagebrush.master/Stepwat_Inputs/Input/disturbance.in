#                Group definitions


# killyr = kill all members of this group at end of this year.
#          0 == don't kill
# killfreq_startyr = start year for killing due to fire, which will continue at the specified kill frequency
# Prescribed_killfreq = frequency to kill. 
#            if > 1 yearly interval, only prescribed fire occur after killfreq_startyr.  
#            if 0 < Prescribed_killfrq < 1 yearly possibility, occur  with the wild fire whose parameters are below.
#            if = 0 no prescribed fire. 
#            Overrides killyr.
# extirp = year at which all group members are extirpated
#       (without recovery) from the plot. 0==don't use, >0 == year # 
# mort =  switch to allow age-independent/slowgrowth mortality
#         functions.0 = don't use; 1 = use.
# proportion_killed = proportional killing that mimics fire at given kill year/killfreq. This is the proportion of biomass 
# 	   removed by fire.
# proportion_recovered = proportionally recovered all members of the group after kill year.
# grazing_frq = frequency of grazing.  if < 1, yearly probability,
#            if > 1 yearly interval, after grazingfreq_startyr. 
#            Overrides grazingyear.
# proportion_grazing = proportion of biomass removed due to grazing. 
# grazingfreq_startyr = start year for grazing

#TM - density values from Biondini et al 1998 - used density% in Table 2 for p.cool.forb (Achillea millefolium) and
#	p.warm.forb (Grindelia squarrosa)
#TM - density values for annual cool grasses from (http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/graminoid/brojap/all.html) converted 56 stems/sqft to stems/sqmeter
#TM - density for perennial warm grasses from (http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/graminoid/koemac/all.html#4) 
#  used 1052 KOMA per 2 rod squar and converted to 11 per meter square
#TM - densities from GZTX data for shrub (gusa) & a.warm.forb(chal - used same for a.cool.forb) & p.cool.grass (stco)
#TM - need density for a.warm.grass - but right now turned off so insterted arbitraty number
# space parameter for sagebrush, p.cool.grass, p.warm.grass, a.cool.grass, a.warm.grass, forbs from Bradford & Lauenroth 2006
# space parameter for shrubs was a guess (KP) 
#TM 10.6.2015 - tested various stretch values for sagebrush and found stretch of 8 to be best paired with irate 0.02
