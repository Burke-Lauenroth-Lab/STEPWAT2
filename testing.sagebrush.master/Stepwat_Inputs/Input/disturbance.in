#                Group definitions


# killyr = kill all members of this group at end of this year.
#          0 == don't kill
# killfreq_startyr = start year for killing due to fire, which will continue at the specified kill frequency
# Prescribed_killfreq = frequency to kill. 
#            if > 1 yearly interval, only prescribed fire occur after killfreq_startyr. Must be set to a floating point
#			 number: xx.x, 10.0. 
#            if 0 < Prescribed_killfrq < 1 yearly possibility, occur  with the wild fire whose parameters are below.
#            if = 0 no prescribed fire. 
#            Overrides killyr.
# extirp = year at which all group members are extirpated
#       (without recovery) from the plot. 0==don't use, >0 == year # 
# mort =  switch to allow age-independent/slowgrowth mortality
#         functions.0 = don't use; 1 = use.
# proportion_killed = proportional killing that mimics fire at given kill year/killfreq. This is the proportion of biomass 
# 	   removed by fire.
# proportion_recovered = proportionally recovered all members of the group after kill year.
# grazing_frq = frequency of grazing.  if < 1, yearly probability,
#            if > 1 yearly interval, after grazingfreq_startyr. 
#            Overrides grazingyear.
# proportion_grazing = proportion of biomass removed due to grazing. 
# grazingfreq_startyr = start year for grazing
